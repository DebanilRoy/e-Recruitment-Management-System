# e-Recruitment Management System (e-RMS)

The e-Recruitment Management System (e-RMS) is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the recruitment process for public sector and institutional organizations. It facilitates end-to-end recruitment workflowsâ€”from publishing recruitment notices and receiving applications to generating rank lists and sending appointment letters.

The system supports multiple user roles (applicant and recruiter) and is built with modular, role-based access control. Key features include application verification, subject-wise result entry, automated ranking based on custom criteria, dynamic vacancy tracking, and real-time feedback via modals and notifications.

e-RMS is built with modern web technologies (React, PHP, MySQL) and is structured for scalability and future integration with third-party recruitment agencies, mobile platforms, and document verification services.
